# STOCK MARKET NEWS 

This project is one of my favourite ones. It encouraged me to learn more about the stck market and how technology is being used to run the markets. I just realised how important is technology for economies of the world. From electricity to the internet, technology has solved a lot of problems and has made our lives beyond comfortable.

This was the first time, I experienced working with real stock market data and APIs. It feels amazing to experience the world through data. Even though each number is more than what it appears, holding so much meaning in the real world but we are unable to interpret and understand it.
